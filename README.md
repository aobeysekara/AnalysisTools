# AnalysisTools
(WIP)
Python tools and examples for analysis of numerical results (such as from IC-FERST/Fluidity) that use VTK (such as vtu and pvtu files)
- works for parallel and serial vtk output files
- outputs results to matplotlib plot files
- Main classes and VTK scripts are located in directory <CFDAnalysisTools>

Step 1:
- Fork 
Step 2:
- Check which version of VTK you are using (tested with vtk6)
- Run example as in CFDAnalysisTools_example (which compares experimental results in a csv file with results derived from a line probe in VTK) 

Run the test case using 'python CFDAnalysisTools_test.py' in the test folder to check if this works in your system
